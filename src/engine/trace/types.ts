/**
 * Phase 11: the Explainable AWS Simulation Trace Engine's data model. Every entry answers all
 * four questions a student needs, as four distinct fields rather than one prose blob:
 *
 *   WHAT happened?        -> `component` + `decision`
 *   WHERE did it happen?  -> `resource`
 *   WHY did it happen?    -> `reason` (detailed) / `simpleExplanation` (plain-English)
 *   WHICH AWS RULE?       -> `awsRule`
 *
 * This is built by directly composing the real per-domain evaluators (`network/nacl.ts`,
 * `network/securityGroup.ts`, `iam/evaluate.ts`, `service/registry.ts`) rather than routing
 * through `engine/pipeline`'s `HopCheck`/`PipelineResult` - that model already collapses every one
 * of those evaluators' rich structured output (rule numbers, matched SG rules, IAM's own
 * `IamTraceStep[]`) down to a single free-text `detail` string before it would ever reach here
 * (confirmed: `engine/pipeline/engine.ts`'s `evaluate-iam`/`evaluate-nacl` steps discard exactly
 * that data). Composing the ground-truth evaluators directly keeps the evidence intact.
