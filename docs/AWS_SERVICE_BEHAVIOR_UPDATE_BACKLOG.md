# AWS service behavior update and integration backlog

Audit date: 2026-09-13  
Status: planning backlog; unchecked items are not implemented by this document.

## Scope and evidence

Reviewed the service catalog and registry, all service-model families, live request/adapters and child-call path, IAM/network integration seams, validation/failure interfaces, canvas/context trace mapping, capability evidence tables, reference templates, and relevant test suites. Enumerated source/test files; this is a behavior-focused repository audit, not a claim of line-by-line review of every SVG, stylesheet, or unrelated cost/UI file.

The appendix is generated from the actual catalog and registry: **327 catalog entries; 33 dedicated model registrations; 294 generic model fallbacks**. A dedicated model can be only a health check. Four generic entries appear in the curated live-adapter list: three client abstractions and App Runner. Some catalog entries are concepts or variants rather than distinct AWS services.

**No service is certified FULL by this audit.** All AWS-service entries need either correction, deeper behavior, or explicit unsupported coverage. Keep client abstractions as simulation inputs, not AWS services requiring full implementation.

Current baseline: `npm test` was run for this audit; all 312 tests passed (304 engine/conformance and 8 UI integration tests). The inventory was also checked programmatically: 327 rows, 327 unique IDs, no missing catalog entries. A passing test proves only its asserted scenario; model-existence tests and generic health checks are not AWS fidelity evidence.

## Fix these shared blockers first

- [ ] **P0-A: Authoritative execution contract.** UI calls `runLiveSimulation` → legacy adapters. `runUnifiedPipeline` remains separate; some experiments and tests call compatibility `runSimulation` without IAM. Selectively delegate to shared evaluators and verify live behavior before retiring compatibility paths.
- [ ] **P0-B: Packet and route context.** Connect source/destination IP, port, protocol, VPC and subnet route-table associations to every hop. Live firewall calls omit source CIDR/port context in places; standalone evaluator tests do not establish live enforcement.
- [ ] **P0-C: SG/NACL directions.** Keep SG statefulness distinct from NACL statelessness. Check egress and ingress plus actual response packet; replace the return-path search for an ephemeral-rule label with rule evaluation. Preserve the recently corrected subnet-only NACL inspector.
- [ ] **P0-D: IAM identity and policy context.** Remove synthetic service principals/ARN assumptions from authoritative tests; validate resource policies, boundaries, session/SCP context and cross-account rules only for documented supported cases. Trust-policy matching alone is not full STS authorization.
- [ ] **P0-E: Child calls.** `ecsDependencyCalls.ts` runs direct ECS→DynamoDB calls but skips route selection, source egress and explicit return-path evaluation. Missing targets are filtered away; optional IAM denial still terminates the parent. The explanatory “returned” string and `returnsToNodeId` are not an actual reverse packet stage. Add explicit parent/child IDs, call/response stages, required/optional behavior and cache state.
- [ ] **P0-F: Animation truth.** `CustomConnectionEdge.tsx` distributes load across healthy siblings independently of the execution engine. Move selection/allocation into engine results so each bubble corresponds to a recorded request or explicitly labeled aggregate.
- [ ] **P0-G: Capability truth.** `capability/registry.ts` treats trivial validation as coverage and derives FULL from coarse booleans. Replace certification with behavior IDs and live conformance evidence; unknown applicability must not count as proven NOT_APPLICABLE.
- [ ] **P0-H: Failure consistency.** Reconcile generic failed-health checks, service failover branches and child-call results. Test surviving calls, AZ scope, required dependencies, and failure timing through the same live entry point.
- [ ] **P0-I: Stable identifiers.** The DIT template now uses `ecr`, but the catalog and dedicated ECR model use `ecr_registry`. Correct or explicitly alias it and regression-test every template node ID. Do not silently replace existing user canvas data.
- [ ] **P0-J: Validation versus simulation versus quality.** Keep these results separate; route absence, IAM rejection and lack of redundancy must not become interchangeable findings.

### Network and identity objects outside the catalog

These need their own behavior work even though the appendix has no separate catalog row for each:

| Object | Required next behavior | Integration proof |
|---|---|---|
| Subnets | Logical VPC association, valid/non-overlapping CIDR, actual route-table association | Same VPC internal call survives NAT failure |
| Security groups | ENI attachments, packet-aware CIDR/reference rules, inbound/outbound and stateful response | ALB→ECS allowed; unrelated source denied |
| NACLs | Ordered rules for both directions and ephemeral response ports | Outbound request allowed but response denied produces timeout |
| ENIs | Addresses, SG IDs and subnet/AZ identity independent of drawing position | Task or instance moves only through a modeled configuration change |
| Routes | Longest-prefix selection, target existence and blackhole state | More-specific route beats default and explains selected route |
| STS | Caller authorization plus trust/context, session credentials/expiry within declared scope | Trusted-but-unauthorized caller denied where AWS requires both |
| AZs | Explicit placement/replicas and dependency scope | One AZ outage preserves an independent AZ path |

## Ordered service work

## Test expectations that need correction, not weaker assertions

1. **ALB all-unhealthy behavior:** shared routing logic equates all unhealthy with no target and 503. AWS describes fail-open routing when only unhealthy targets remain. Distinguish registration/health from actual target reachability; a routed unhealthy target can still fail. Update the ALB conformance and legacy expectations with documented cases. [AWS target health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html)
2. **NLB behavior:** shared ALB-like errors do not establish L4 behavior. Test fail-open and connection resets separately. [AWS NLB troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-troubleshooting.html)
3. **SQS acknowledgment:** `SVC-SQS-SUCCESS-001` expects 202 as AWS behavior. SendMessage returns HTTP 200 on success; an application may separately return 202. Preserve an application-response test and add the actual queue API contract. Durability does not prove a failed endpoint can accept a publish. [AWS SendMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html)
4. **Fargate scaling:** `SVC-FARGATE-SERVERLESS-SCALING-001` and the generic capacity model need review; Fargate infrastructure management is not proof of automatic ECS desired-count scaling. Configure the scaling policy and distinguish desired/running tasks.
5. **IAM tests:** validation-only missing-role tests must be supplemented by actual live denied-request tests. Model existence/tier checks belong to internal regression, not AWS behavior counts.
6. **DynamoDB/RDS/Aurora:** shared relational failover assertions need service-specific replacement; a Multi-AZ flag alone does not establish a surviving endpoint or recovery time.
7. **CloudFront:** extension-based cache HIT tests encode an approximation. Retain only as labeled legacy compatibility; test cache contents/key/TTL and explicit miss/hit in the authoritative engine.

For each corrected test, record its old assertion, official source, new expected decision and retained regression purpose. Do not delete or loosen an assertion merely to obtain a green run.

## Integration slices and acceptance gates

1. **Repair current DIT child call:** routing + IAM + actual response trace; absent dependency must fail configuration; optional denial follows explicit caller policy; no S3 fetch after a required policy lookup fails.
2. **Networking and IAM foundation:** VPC-scoped routes, packet security, supported authorization context; prove EC2→RDS and ECS→S3 with positive and negative cases.
3. **Core compute:** EC2 then Lambda then ECS/Fargate then EKS; share ENI/identity contracts without conflating their scheduling models.
4. **Data:** S3 then RDS/Aurora then DynamoDB; explicit operations and resource identities; add EBS/EFS when required by the chosen compute slice.
5. **Request entry:** ALB/NLB then API Gateway; engine produces actual per-request target decisions and response outcomes.
6. **Async and edge:** SQS/SNS then CloudFront then Route 53. Do not interpret DNS answers or queue delivery as synchronous HTTP forwarding.
7. **Supporting dependencies:** ECR then EFS then KMS then Secrets Manager then EventBridge; extend the DIT workflow with Cognito, Rekognition and Amplify as separate bounded tasks.
8. **Remaining catalog:** select one entry from the appendix based on student scenarios. Start with the generic backlog below, then write a service-specific specification.

Every slice must include:
- [ ] Official behavior reference and precise scope; uncertain behavior stays UNKNOWN.
- [ ] Typed configuration and reusable service/network/IAM rules outside React.
- [ ] Success, invalid configuration, missing permission, blocked network, service failure, and surviving unrelated request tests.
- [ ] Same result through Send Request and Task Flow, including child calls and failure injection.
- [ ] Ordered explanatory decisions and animation derived from those decisions.
- [ ] Existing reference regressions pass, except documented AWS corrections.
- [ ] Determinism test and no mutation of input architecture.
- [ ] Capability evidence and deviations updated; no FULL badge based on model registration.

## Generic backlog for every remaining entry

**G1** — Define the first useful operation and configuration constraints from the service's official guide/API reference. Identify whether it is data plane, control plane, asynchronous delivery, or only an educational object.  
**G2** — Model endpoint/network identity, action/resource/principal and real dependencies; define success, denial and unavailable outcomes.  
**G3** — Add one dedicated module and wire it into the authoritative live path, including response and failure propagation.  
**G4** — Add official-source conformance and integration tests; keep unsupported features labeled.  
**G5** — Promote only the proven capability slice. A generic health-check success is not evidence of the real service operation.

Each generic appendix entry is a candidate requiring G1–G5. Exact AWS semantics for these long-tail entries were not researched individually in this audit. They are deliberately not guessed.

## Complete catalog inventory

“Dedicated” means registered code, not deep fidelity. “Generic” means catalog fallback; common graph/health behavior may still apply. The stage links each entry to the detailed table or G1–G5. Client entries are retained for inventory completeness.

## Source map and audit boundaries

- `src/data/serviceCatalog.ts`, `src/data/referenceArchitectures.ts`: inventory/configuration and integration scenarios.
- `src/engine/service/registry.ts`, `models/*.ts`, `genericModel.ts`: dedicated versus fallback behavior.
- `src/engine/simulation/liveSimulation.ts`, `requestSimulator.ts`, `adapters/*.ts`: actual UI execution and child calls.
- `src/engine/pipeline/engine.ts`, `service/interaction.ts`: separate evaluation paths; not assumed equivalent to live UI.
- `src/engine/network/*`, `iam/*`, `validation/*`, `failure/*`, `trace/*`: shared foundation and integration limitations.
- `src/engine/capability/*`: current coverage claims; audited as claims, not certification.
- `src/context/ArchitectureContext.tsx`, `src/components/canvas/CustomConnectionEdge.tsx`: result display and independent animation decisions.
- `test/*.test.ts`, `test/ui/ui-integration.test.ts`, `tests/aws-conformance/*`: regression versus AWS evidence.
- Existing `docs/FINAL_AWS_SIMULATOR_AUDIT.md`, `docs/SERVICE_BEHAVIOR_EXTENSION.md`, `docs/DIT_TEMPLATE_CORRECTIONS.md` provide historical context; source code takes precedence over stale status statements.

Additional official references for upcoming slices: [ECS task role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html), [ECS execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html). These roles authorize different actors and must not be merged.

No simulator code or tests were changed for this backlog. A fresh build is unnecessary for a Markdown-only deliverable. The 327-row inventory is exhaustive for the current catalog; the behavior list is a prioritized implementation plan, not an exhaustive enumeration of all AWS features.
